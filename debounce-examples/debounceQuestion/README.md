# Implement a 'Debounce' function

A debounce function is one that will prevent multiple calls to a server if they are happening in quick succession and then just allow that last one to go.

An example would be in a search bar as someone types the query. You don't want the query to fire every time a key stroke is made but when they have finished typing.

The question is setup for you to try and implement the function.
